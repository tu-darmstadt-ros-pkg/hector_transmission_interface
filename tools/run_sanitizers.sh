# Build and run this package's test suite under AddressSanitizer or
# ThreadSanitizer. Manual: nothing in CI runs the full suite this way, because
# TSan costs roughly ten times the wall clock and the first run of either needs
# a human to read the reports.
#
# Only this repository's packages are instrumented. Its dependencies are not, which is the
# whole reason tools/sanitizers/*.supp exist - see the comments in there for what that does
# and does not let the sanitizers see. Keeping the instrumented set equal to this repository
# is what makes a local run and the CI job mean the same thing.
#
#   tools/run_sanitizers.sh                 # asan, then tsan, whole suite
#   tools/run_sanitizers.sh tsan            # tsan only
#   tools/run_sanitizers.sh tsan --preset ci   # the subset the CI job runs
#   tools/run_sanitizers.sh asan -R estop   # only tests matching a regex
#   tools/run_sanitizers.sh tsan --no-build # re-run against an existing tree
#   tools/run_sanitizers.sh tsan --isolate  # one gtest case per process, counted separately
#
# --isolate exists because a sanitizer's state is per process and sticky: once TSan sees one mutex
# misused, every later access under that mutex is reported too, so the count for a whole binary is
# neither additive nor attributable. One case per process makes each number mean something, at the
# cost of repeating every fixture setup. Use it to decide what is real; use the default to decide
# whether anything changed.
#
# Each mode builds into its own <workspace>/build-<mode>-<package> tree, so a normal colcon
# build is never clobbered, switching back needs no rebuild, and another repository's copy of
# this script cannot reach into this one's.
